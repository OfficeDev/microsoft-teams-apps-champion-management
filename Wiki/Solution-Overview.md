### Champion Leaderboard

Leaderboard solution is intended to add a gaming aspect to the Teams Champions program by allowing champions to earn points for the various ways they are promoting and supporting the internal adoption of their areas of interest. This also gives an opportunity to reflect their activity in comparison to other champs. Leaderboard has mainly 2 different views based on the role of that employee.
Roles can be categorized as:

### Admin/Moderator OR Champion view

### Digital Badge ![Champion logo](../Images/Champion_small.png)
Digital Badge is intended to allow Microsoft 365 Champions to apply a ‘Champion’ badge on their profile image. It provides an easy and seamless process to share the recognition as a champion with the team.
 <br/>

CMP administrators can upload multiple badges in the “Digital Badge Assets” library in the share point site. Champions can select from multiple badges and apply on their profile picture.

Additionally, administrators can also tag a digital badge with a specific tournament in the "Digital Badge Assets" list in share point when Tournament of Teams is enabled. Champions would have to complete a tournament to earn tournament specific badges. 

To make a digital badge open to all champions do not tag any tournament for that badge in the "Digital Badge Assets" list. The "Tournament" field in the list should be left empty.

### Tournament of Teams

- Tournament of Teams enables the organization to create and conduct tournaments for anyone in the organization to use to drive healthy usage habits and skilling on the areas of focus. The App also includes a gamification element where users gain points by completing activities assigned as part of the tournament. Users also gain access to tournament specific badges once they complete the tournaments. They can apply the badges using Digital Badge feature of Champion Management Platform. (note that at this time the digital badge component is only enabled for Champions and will be enabled in a future release for all users) 
- Tournament of Teams is not enabled by default. It must be enabled by CMP admin from the CMP landing page’s Admin section. By default, the Champion Management Platform admin who enables “Tournament of Teams” from CMP Admin section will be added as Admin for Tournament of Teams. More admins can be added through the Manage Admins section of the Tournament of Teams landing page.
