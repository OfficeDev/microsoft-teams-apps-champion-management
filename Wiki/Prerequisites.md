Ensure the administrator who will install the app has access to following:

#### SharePoint Admin role 
- Permission to load application package into SharePoint Online
- Permission to approve API requests in SharePoint Online
- Ability to create a site in SharePoint Online

Once the package has been installed, API granted, and solution synced to Teams, the same admin will likely also be asked to complete the first run experience. This first run creates the SharePoint site (ChampionManagementPlatform) that all assets of this solution will be created under. Additionally permissions need to be modified by an owner of this site to include edit/contribute rights for the organizations ability to interact with the solution.
